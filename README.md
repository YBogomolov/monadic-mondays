# Monadic Mondays

This repository contains code samples for [#monadicmonday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/monadicmonday) topics.

You can also find monthly compilations [on Medium](https://medium.com/tag/monadicmonday/archive) and [on Dev.to](https://dev.to/t/monadicmonday).

## How to run

To run the examples, you'll need to install all dependencies by issuing `npm ci` command. After that you can run code for each episode using `npm run epN`, where `N ∈ [1, K]`, and `K` is the number of last published episode.

### Extra bits

1. `npm run ep5:test` – run tests for Tagless Final
2. `npm run ep8:stack-fail` – run a naïve stack-unsafe Free moand evaluation
3. `npm run ep8:stack` - run a stack-safe trampolined Free monad evaluation
